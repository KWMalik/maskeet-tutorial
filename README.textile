h1. Maskeet Tutorial

This is the official documentation for the Maskeet tutorial. I began with this documentaion effort because i did not find 
any good step by step tutorial for Merb.  

This tutorial is a port of the Askeet tutorial (http://www.symfony-project.org/askeet/1_0/en).

h1. Contribuiting

You know the basics of contribuiting in Github just fork the project and begin throwing docs or code, check out the maskeet code too in it's own
repository.
